Order Execution Logic: The bot must place orders on both exchanges based on the detected arbitrage opportunities.
Risk Management: Implement stop-loss and take-profit strategies to manage risk.
API Rate Limit Handling: Ensure the bot respects API rate limits to avoid bans.
Logging and Monitoring: Keep detailed logs of all actions for monitoring and debugging.
Security Measures: Securely manage API keys and handle potential errors.


Here's an outline and implementation approach:

1. Order Execution Logic
Buying on Binance and Selling on Bybit (and vice versa):

You'll need two functions, one to buy and one to sell on each platform. Each function should check if the trade is profitable after considering fees and slippage.

2. Risk Management
Stop-Loss: If the price moves against the trade by a certain percentage, the bot should exit the position.
Take-Profit: Set a target profit percentage to close the trade when reached.
3. API Rate Limit Handling
Implement a rate limiter or delay between API calls.
4. Logging and Monitoring
Use logging to record all trades, errors, and important events.
5. Security Measures
Store API keys securely, avoid hardcoding them, and use environment variables.
